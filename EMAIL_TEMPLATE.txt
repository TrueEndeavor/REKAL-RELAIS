PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

REKAL Relais is a live micro-learning platform that enables real-time classroom differentiation for French secondary education.

The Challenge: Teachers must teach 30+ students at vastly different knowledge levels (some 2 years ahead, others 2 years behind) with no real-time visibility into who understands and who is lost.

Our Solution: Instant micro-assessments with live teacher analytics. Students answer quick MCQ questions on their devices while the teacher sees real-time class-wide accuracy, individual progress, and performance indicators - enabling immediate intervention.

Key Innovation: Japanese-style "kikan-shido" (live classroom monitoring) powered by technology - seeing understanding as it happens, not weeks later on tests.

Impact: Zero prep time (5 pre-loaded topics), instant deployment, works in any 55-minute class period with existing devices.

Built in 48 hours. Deployed and ready for classroom testing.
