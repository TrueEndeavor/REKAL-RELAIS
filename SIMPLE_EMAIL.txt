PRODUCT SUMMARY:

REKAL Relais - Live micro-learning platform for classroom differentiation

Problem: Teachers must teach 30+ students at vastly different levels with no real-time visibility into who understands and who is lost.

Solution: Quick MCQ assessments where students answer on their devices while teachers see live analytics showing individual progress, class accuracy, and performance indicators - enabling immediate intervention.

Innovation: Japanese "kikan-shido" (live classroom monitoring) powered by technology - seeing understanding as it happens, not weeks later on tests.

Status: Fully deployed and ready for classroom testing. Built in 48 hours.
